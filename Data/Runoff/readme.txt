This dataset provides input data and for the stochastic simulations performed by Brunner and Gilleland (2023). 

Dataset components:

(1) Shapefile of 925 nearly natural catchments in the Alps: Catchments.shp
ID: catchment ID
Area_km2: catchment area in km2
elevmean: mean catchment elevation
Outlet X: X-coordinate of catchment outlet
Outlet Y: Y-coordinate of catchment outlet

(2) Daily streamflow, temperatue, and precipitation for the 925 catchments for the period 1981-2016: runoff_multi_sites_nonstat_DFSTaR_1980-2017.rda (dataset can be opened in R and used to run the stochastic model PRSim directly.
YYYY: Year
MM: Month
