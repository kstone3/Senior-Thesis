\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Importance of Glacial Melting in Mountain Hydrology}
Glacial melting plays a significant role in the hydrology of mountain catchment areas as shown in (Fountain and Tangborn, 1985). In order to 
understand how the hydrology of these mountain catchment areas will evolve as glaciers melt and retreat, scientists create computer models to predict 
this evolution. The runoff from these mountain catchments is often used as a water source for downstream communities \cite{ref1}. As shown in 
(Fountain and Tangborn 1985), basins with greater glaciation produce more runoff. As the glaciers in these basins melt and retreat, 
change in meltwater patterns and amounts can affect communities that rely on it in a variety of ways.

\subsection{Role of Numerical Modeling in Understanding Glacial Runoff}
One of the best ways to understand how glaciers affect the runoff of the basins that they occupy is by using computer models. 
Scientists have been using computers to model glaciers for several decades, 
such as (Iken A, 1981). As computational resources have grown, these models have grown in complexity and resolution, leading 
to highly computationally expensive models. These models have proved to be very accurate in modeling the past and present state of a variety 
of glacier types all around the world.

\subsection{Challenges in Computational Modeling of Glaciers}
Many of these more advanced models can be quite complex to run because they require a variety of input parameters and different configurations to run the model. The 
goal of this paper is to write a simple Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)-Mass Balance model that is easy to run and understand while still 
being generalizable to a variety of small mountain glaciers. The advantage of using much more advanced models is that they often do 
a much better job at modeling the ice dynamics of glaciers. For some glaciers such as marine calving glaciers, accurate ice dynamics are 
crucial for accurate modeling, as shown in (Amaral et al., 2020). However, on smaller mountain glaciers, modeling in three dimensions is often 
unnecessary and simpler models such as the SIA can be used. This paper will compare the results of a simple SIA-Mass Balance model to the 
results of OGGM, a more advanced model using a simplified version of the Stokes equations.

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Prior Research on SIA vs. Stokes Models}
Table 1 shows that there are significant differences in computational time between a SIA model and a Stokes model. 
The authors show that there are some instances where SIA models do significantly worse than 
Stokes models, such as glaciers on steep slopes and in narrow valleys, because SIA models only approximate the Stokes 
equations. One of these approximations is to ignore horizontal stress gradients which can cause a SIA model to deviate from a Stokes model 
significantly in predicted glacier flow and expansion. In the 2D model, the bed characteristics and slope become the limiting factor of the SIA model.
They found instances in which the SIA models performed well 
compared to Stokes models--particularly large flat glaciers with relatively free edges. One thing to note about this comparison study is 
that the authors are looking at the shape, area, and velocity profile of the glacier, whereas this study will focus on the water output 
(surface mass loss) of the glacier.

\subsection{Applying SIA Models to Alpine Glaciers}
    There are several papers, (Le Meur et al., 2004; Le Meur et al., 2003; Kessler et al., 2006), that use an SIA model for alpine glaciers. The consensus 
from those papers is that SIA models only work well on alpine glaciers with a low aspect ratio, defined as the thickness-to-extent ratio 
(Le Meur et al., 2004). The glacier used by this study will have a low aspect ratio and therefore a SIA model should work well to model it.
\subsection{Applying SIA Models to Glacial Runoff}
    Additionally, there is precedent for using a SIA-Mass Balance model for modeling water runoff from glaciers (Naz et al., 2014). This paper used 
a SIA model to approximate the ice dynamics and a mass balance model to approximate the accumulation and ablation patterns on the glacier. 
As shown in their paper, the SIA model was able to accurately predict the glacier, and the coupled hydrological model was able to predict 
the stream flow accurately---only overestimating the July flow by an average of 13\% and underestimating the August and September flow by an 
average of 2\%.

\section{Thesis Statement}
How much do ice dynamics affect the model result when modeling small mountain glaciers for water runoff? I theorize that if using a simple 
1-dimensional SIA-Mass Balance model on small mountain glaciers (with a low aspect ratio), the mass balance profile will have a 
much larger effect on the output of the model and its overall accuracy than the modeled ice dynamics. The results of the SIA-Mass Balance 
model and the OGGM model will be compared to the actual stream flow data to verify this hypothesis.
\subsection{Study Site}
\textbf{\large South Cascade Glacier, Washington State}

In this study, I will focus on modeling the South Cascade Glacier in the North Cascades region of Washington State. The South Cascade Glacier is 
roughly 1.68 square kilometers with widths ranging from 400m-1200m, has a mean elevation of roughly 1900 meters, (GLIMS) faces North, an average thickness of 99 meters, and a 
maximum thickness of 195 meters (GlaThiDa Consortium, 2020). The glacier is small, not overly steep (average slope of 7.14 degrees along this studies 
centerline in 2021), and has a low aspect ratio (thickness to extent ratio), and therefore a
SIA model should be able to accurately model its ice dynamics. On the other hand, the glacier is large enough to exhibit some movement 
and produce a measurable amount of runoff throughout the year.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Model Development}
\subsubsection{Model Overview}
\textbf{Model Structure:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2cm]
    \item SIA ice dynamics model
    \item Temperature degree day and precipitation mass balance model
    \item Temperature degree day and precipitation (snow fall/melt and rain) model
\end{enumerate}

There are two sections to getting a complete model run, the spinup and the data driven run. The spinup section of the model runs for 500 years and aims to replicate the 
state of the glacier in 1984 when weather data becomes readily available. The spinup run starts with the bed topography and no ice and uses a simple mass balance 
equation to accumulate ice to simulate the glacier state in 1984. The data driven run starts in 1984 with the simulated spinup glacier and applies a temperature and 
precipitation driven mass balance model to model how the glacier changes until 2024. The data driven run also contains the precipitation model to calculate the runoff 
from snow melt and rainfall.

\subsubsection{Spinup Run}
This section uses the simple mass balance equation below
\begin{equation}(Z_g-\text{ELA})*\gamma /365.25\end{equation}
This uses a $\gamma$ of 0.0309 to calculate the mass balance in meters per day. When the spinup hits the year 1900 the ELA is shifted up from 1903m to 1930m to simulate the 
retreat state of the glacier. 

\subsubsection{Data Driven Run Setup}
The data driven section of the model run relies on a variety of data in order to run. It requires daily temperature and precipitation data, 
a bed topography, yearly glacier area, and total basin area to run. In order to tune the input parameters the model needs winter and summer mass balance 
data. The model needs seven input parameters to run: ice melt factor, snow melt factor, temperature lapse rate, start accumulation factor, end 
accumulation factor, avalanche percentage and precipitation conversion factor. The details of how these input parameters are calculated and used 
in the model are explained in the following sections.

The centerline bed topography was calculated using latitude, longitude and elevation bed topography from Robert Jacobel \cite{ref4}. 
I used the ArcGIS Kriging Interpolation function \cite{ref5} to interpolate this point elevation data into a complete 
bed topography across the whole glacier. I then traced a line down the center of the glacier using the interpolated bed and got bed elevation points for the line 
from the interpolated data. I then used these new latitude, longitude, and elevation points to create the one-dimensional bed topography for 
the model.

\subsubsection{Ice Dynamics}
\paragraph{SIA Model}
The SIA model is a one-dimensional model that uses the shallow ice approximation to approximate the ice dynamics of the glacier. This model 
calculates the one dimensional ice flux of the glacier using equation 2. 
\begin{equation}Q=\frac{2A}{n+2}(\rho g|\frac{\partial z_s}{\partial x}|)^n\frac{H^5}{5}\end{equation}

\paragraph{Assumptions}
The SIA ice flux equation makes several assumptions. First, the equations are 1-dimensional, so they neglect longitudinal stress, and ice only 
flows downhill. Second, the equations also assume that there is no basal sliding of the glacier. Third, the equations only use gravity as the 
driver of ice flow; they ignore other forces such as lateral and basal stress. Fourth, this set of equations assumes that the horizontal 
dimensions of the modeled glacier are much larger than the vertical dimensions.

\subsubsection{Mass Balance Model}
The mass balance of the glacier is calculated using temperature and precipitation data from the Diablo Dam weather station at 272m. The 
temperature at the glacier is calculated by using a month-specific lapse rate. 
The precipitation at the glacier is calculated by multiplying the precipitation at the Diablo Dam weather station by the precipitation conversion factor of 1.58 
obtained from (reference). The ablation of the glacier is calculated by using a combination of an ice melt factor and a snow melt factor. Above the ELA the 
ablation is calculated by equation 3 for $T>0$
\begin{equation}b_s=T*M_{s}\end{equation}
Below the ELA the ablation is calculated by equation 4 for $T>0$
\begin{equation}b_s=T*(M_{s}+((ELA-Z_g)/(ELA-min(Z_g)))*(M_{i}-M_{s}))\end{equation}
The result of this equation is the snow melt factor being used at the ELA and a linear increase in the melt factor until it hits the ice melt 
factor at the base of the glacier. This set of equations assumes that in the accumulation zone (above the ELA) the surface is always snow year 
round, and below the ELA the surface transitions from snow to ice as you decrease in elevation.
The accumulation of the glacier is calculated using equation 5 for $T<0$
\begin{equation}b_w=P*\alpha*({Accum}_{l}+((Y-1984)/(2024-1984))*({Accum}_{l}-{Accum}_{u}))\end{equation}
This equation starts the accumulation factor at ${Accum}_{l}$ at the start of the data driven run in 1984 and linearly increases it to $Accum_{u}$ by the end 
of the run in 2024.

\subsubsection{Precipitation Model}
\paragraph{Snow Model}
The snow melt model uses precipitation and temperature data to accumulate and melt snow. 
The equation below is used to calculate the change in snow depth per timestep 
\begin{equation}S_{d} += 
\begin{cases} 
  P*\alpha & T \leq 0,\\
  -\text{min}(|M_{s}*T|,S_{d}) &  T > 0
\end{cases}\end{equation}
The snow melt is constrained so that there cannot a negative snow depth. 
The total volume of snow melt is calculated by equation 7.
\begin{equation}S_{mv}=(M_{s}*T)*({Area}_{b}-{Area}_{g})\end{equation}
This give us the total volume of snow melt on the non-glacierized areas of the basin. Any snow that falls on the glacier is factored into 
the glacier mass balance equations and accumulated on the glacier.
\paragraph{Rain Model}
The rain is simply modeled by $P*\alpha$ for positive temperature days. The volume of rain is calculated equation 8
\begin{equation}R_{v}=P*\alpha*{Area}_{b}\end{equation}
This calculates the rain for the whole basin because rain is not factored into the glacier mass balance. This assumes that  that any rain 
that falls runs out of the basin on the day it falls.

% \textbf{ask mom to review this section in particular, make sure it makes sense}
\paragraph{Avalanche Model}
In order to stop snow accumulating to unrealistic depths at high elevations an avalanche model is used. This model avalanches the 
snow above 2123m once per year on a randomly chosen date (chosen each year) between January and March. The amount of snow that 
avalanches is controlled by the avalanche percentage. On the chosen that the snow depth above 2123m is decreased by the avalanche 
percentage and that snow is evenly distributed below 1900m. The result of this is the average snow depth approximately 2m water 
equivalent in September and October before starting to accumulate again. With an avalanche percentage of 0 it is approximately 5.5m water 
equivalent in September and October. This decrease in snow depth yields a more realistic model and improves runoff model accuracy by about 
one percentage point. This is caused by there being more snow available for melt at the lower elevations where the 
temperature is higher.

\subsubsection{Glacial Melt Model}
The glacial melt model uses the mass balance of the glacier to calculate how much volume the glacier is losing. The volume of runoff from the 
glacier is calculated by the equation
\begin{equation}G_{mv}=b_s*{Area}_{g}\end{equation}
\subsection{Model Calibration}
\subsubsection{Data Used for Model}
The temperature and precipitation data used for the model is from the Diablo Dam weather station at 272m. This data is available from 1984-2024 
and is missing 298 days of temperature data and 292 days of precipitation data. The missing temperature data was interpolated 
using the interp function from the numpy python library \cite{ref7}, the missing precipitation data was assumed to be 0. Since the Diablo Dam
weather station is at a significantly lower altitude than the South Cascade Glacier a lapse rate is applied to the temperature data. This lapse 
rate was empirically calculated using data from a weather station at 1830m next to the South Cascade Glacier. This data is available daily from 
2010-2018. Using these two sets of data a average lapse rate was calculated for each month between Diablo Dam and the South Cascade Glacier. 
These values are shown in Table 2. The glacier area data used in 
the model is from the USGS \cite{ref8}. The basin area data was calculated using a DEM from the USGS and the basin outline shown in figure 1.

\subsubsection{Calibration} 
\paragraph{Spinup Calibration}
The spinup initial ELA, ELA in 1900 and $\gamma$ were optimized using the minimize function with the Nelder-Mead method from the scipy library \cite{ref9}.
The optimization was done by minimizing the relative RMSE (equation 10) of the glacier's in 1958 and 1986. The sum of the cross-sectional area of the glacier was used to calculate the RMSE. This metric was chosen to create a glacier with an cross-sectional area as close to the actual glacier as possible. 
The result is a relative RMSE of 6.95\% with RMSE's of 7.27\% and 6.63\% in 1958 and 1986 respectively.

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{RMSE} = \left(\frac{\sqrt{\left( O^{1958}_i - S^{1958}_i \right)^2}}{{O^{1958}}}+\frac{\sqrt{ \left( O^{1986}_i - S^{1986}_i \right)^2}}{{O^{1986}}} \right)/2*100
\end{equation}

\noindent where:
$$O = \text{Measured sum of cross-sectional area}, \quad S=\text{Modeled sum of cross-sectional area}$$

Looking at these figures the difference in the actual glacier vs the modeled glacier at the top of the valley stands out. The modeled glacier is much thicker in this 
location compared to the actual glacier. This may be due to different accumulation patterns on the actual glacier compared to the model, or due to error in the bed 
topography data

\paragraph{Summer Mass Balance Calibration}
The two input parameters that control the summer mass balance are the ice melt factor and the snow melt factor. They were calibrated using yearly summer 
mass balance data available from the USGS from 1984-2024. The minimize function was understanding
to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) (equation 11) between the modeled mass balance and the USGS measured mass balance. 

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{MSE} \;=\; \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \bigl(O_i - S_i\bigr)^2
\end{equation}
    
\noindent where:
$$O = \text{Measured summer mass balance (m)}, \quad S=\text{Modeled summer mass balance (m)}$$

\paragraph{Winter Mass Balance Calibration}
There are also two factors that control the winter mass balance, the start and end accumulation factors. They were tuned using the same 
method as the summer mass balance factors using the USGS yearly winter mass balance data available from 1984-2024.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Comparison plots of the calculated vs measured winter and summer mass balance.}
    \label{fig:mb_comparison}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\paragraph{Avalance Percentage Calibration}
The avalanche percentage was optimized using the same minimize function as the mass balance parameters. Instead of minimizing the MSE, the mean of the 
snow depth over the whole data driven run (1984-2024) was minimized. The mean snow depth was minimized because the almost all of the snow on the 
non-glacierized areas of the basin should melt during the summer. By minimizing the mean snow depth over the whole run, the snow depth during 
the summer will be minimized since the avalanche percent cannot change the amount of snow present in the whole basin, just the elevation it is at. If 
there is more snow at lower elevations then more snow will melt during the summer.

\subsubsection{Model Comparison}
\paragraph{Running OGGM for the South Cascade Glacier}
The Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) was run using the run\_with\_hydro task from the oggm library. This model run used the GSWP3\_W5E5 historical temperature and 
precipitation data \cite{ref10} to model the hydrology of the glacier from 1984-2019. The total runoff from the glacier was calculated using 
runoff from the glacier using the melt\_on\_glacier\_monthly, and liq\_precip\_on\_glacier\_monthly variables. In order 
to calculate the runoff from the non-glacierized areas melt\_off\_glacier\_monthly, and liq\_precip\_off\_glacier\_monthly variables were averaged over the 
SIA model glacier basin area. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Accuracy of SIA Model}
The calculated runoff of the SIA-Mass Balance model was validated using measured streamflow data from 1992-2007, consisting of 2418 
data points, which were aggregated into 91 months (reference list of papers). This data was measured using 
a stream gauge located just below the glacier (refer to Figure 1 for location). The data is in units of mm per day averaged over the basin area (4.46$\text{km}^2$). This was  
converted to cubic meters per day and then 
summed over the month to calculate a monthly runoff. Not every month was complete, so in order to validate the model, the model runoff was saved 
for the same days as the measured data and then a daily average was calculated for each month. 
This paper will look at the model error in terms of daily average runoff per month due to the several incomplete months of data. 
This paper will used 
three types of error to evaluate the model, relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Kling–Gupta Efficiency 
(KGE), defined by the equations below. 
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{RMSE} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( O_i - S_i \right)^2}}{\bar{O}}*100,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{NSE} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( O_i - S_i \right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( O_i - \bar{O} \right)^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{KGE} = 1 - \sqrt{ (r-1)^2 + (\alpha-1)^2 + (\beta-1)^2 },
\end{equation}

\noindent where:
$$O = \text{Observed data}, \quad S=\text{Simulated Data}$$
$$r = \mbox{Correlation coefficient}, \quad \alpha = \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_O}, \quad \beta = \frac{\mu_S}{\mu_O}$$
The results for these three methods are 29.26\%, 0.81 and 0.88 respectively. It is important to note that this error is primarily the model error for 
May-November due to the lack of runoff data outside of those months. There is one instance of January, February, March and April, and six 
instances of December. The model does much better on longer timescales where the relative RMSE of the daily average runoff 
per year drops to 15.21\%.

\subsection{Accuracy of OGGM}
The RMSE, NSE and KGE of OGGM are 45.96\%, 0.53 and 0.72 respectively. OGGM proved to be slightly less accurate when 
compared to the real-world measured runoff data. OGGM uses the GSWP3\_W5E5 climate modeled data instead of measured temperature and precipitation 
data due to the purpose of the model being to model glaciers into the future.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Comparison of Model Accuracies}
The SIA-Mass Balance model is roughly 1.4 times (averaged over the three error metrics) more accurate than OGGM. One reason for the 
higher accuracy of the SIA-Mass Balance model is likely due to it 
using real-world temperature and precipitation data and OGGM using modeled climate data which is less accurate. The SIA model input 
parameters are also tuned to the local climate of the glacier.

\subsection{Mass Balance Model Error}
The relative RMSE of the winter and summer mass balance are 19.01\% and 13.33\% respectively.
Looking at the missing temperature and precipitation one can note a few interesting things about the mass balance model error. There are five years 
with significant gaps (at least one month of missing data) in the temperature and precipitation data. These years are 1984 (missing December), 
1985 (missing January), 1987 (missing July), 1997 (missing March and September) and 2009 (missing May-July). The year with the highest error in 
winter mass balance is 1997 probably due to it missing March data. The measured winter mass balance that year is 3.44m, and the model calculated a 
winter mass balance of 2.65m. One possibility for this is that there was a large amount of snowfall during March of that year, but since the 
precipitation data is missing for that month, the glacier accumulation is 0. According to PRISM (reference) the South Cascade Glacier received 0.57m 
of precipitation during March 1997. Using the mass balance equations above, the accumulation on the glacier during March 1997 with 0.57m of 
precipitation would be 1m, which would increase the winter mass balance for that year form 2.65m to 3.65m, much closer to the measured value. This 
illustrates just how important consistent and reliable weather data is for models like these because a month of missing weather data can skew the 
result.
\paragraph{}
Looking at the summer mass balance in Figure 3, the model does a good job of capturing the trends of the measured summer mass balance, but not 
the amplitude. The modeled summer mass balance consistently doesn't reach the same magnitude as the measured summer mass balance. One reason for this 
could be due to the model not taking cloud cover into effect. For years where the measured summer mass balance was particularly low, there could 
have been a lot of cloud cover which would have reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the glacier and thus reduced the amount of melt. 
There are a lot of nuances in the weather that can change the amount of melt that occurs on the glacier. This model was designed to capture all of 
these nuances with two melt factors. This provides a good generalization of the glacier melt shown by the low RMSE for the summer mass balance data, 
but perhaps does not capture the shorter term effects of the glacier melt.
\subsection{Limitations of the Model}
The largest problem with the runoff model lies with the precipitation model. This model calculates the type of precipitation that falls (rain or 
snow), based on the temperature. It assumes that if the temperature is greater than $0^\circ$ Celsius then the precipitation is rain, and if the 
temperature is less then $0^\circ$ Celsius then then precipitation is snow. Also there is some amount of error in the calculated lapse rate which 
can effect the calculated temperature at the glacier. When the actual temperature at the glacier is right around 0, and precipitation is falling, 
the error in the lapse rate can cause the precipitation to fall as the wrong type. This is a good generalization, but it isn't always true. Looking at the 
error graph, there is a large spike in the error in November of 1995. This is likely due to the model predicting the large amount of precipitation 
during that month falling as snow because the model temperatures are just below $0^\circ$ Celsius, but in reality it most likely fell as rain. This also 
highlights the types of error that can be caused by using a proxy weather station that is not present at the glacier such as this model used. With 
more accurate temperature data for the glacier, then the model might correctly predict the precipitation falling as rain. 
\paragraph{}
It is also important to note that out of the 298 missing days of temperature and 292 missing days of precipitation 63 days of temperature and 64 
days of precipitation were during the 1992-2007 period where runoff data is available. Most notable of these missing days is the month of September 
1997. This entire month is missing temperature and precipitation data, and this entire month is included in the measured runoff data. Looking at the 
error for the month it has a relative RMSE of 30.51\% which is very close to the overall relative RMSE of 29.26\%. This 
means that the error this month is quite typical for the model. The interpolated temperatures for this month range from $10^\circ$ C to $5^\circ$ 
during the month, so the glacier is melting and no glacier accumulation is missed. Also from looking at Figure 10, during September glacier melt is 
contributing the majority of the runoff to the basin, so having zero precipitation in the model for September 1997 would not cause as much error as 
if there was no precipitation for December or January when lack of snowfall could affect the runoff in the following summer.
\paragraph{}
These two examples illustrate that missing precipitation data may be much more detrimental to model accuracy than missing temperature data, partly 
due to temperature data being much easier to interpolate than precipitation data.
\subsection{Interpretations of Model Results}
Even though the glacier is contributing slightly less than half of the total basin runoff on average (47.56\%), it contributes much more during the summer 
months as show in figure 11. Due to the setup of the mass balance model there is no way to easily distinguish how much of the glacier melt is made 
up of glacial ice melting and snow melting off the surface of the glacier. So while Figure 7 shows the average monthly percent of runoff due to glacier 
melt, part of that is snow melting off the glacier surface. 

As the glacier retreats it will contribute less and less water to the basin runoff resulting in a decrease in total runoff. With a smaller glacier 
surface area the peak snow melt will shift earlier in the summer as the snow melts off faster due the more snow falling on rock, and not glacier 
ice which keeps the snow cool throughout the summer. As shown in Figure 7, the peak of the glacier runoff occurs in September, which coincides 
with some of the lowest monthly precipitation amounts as shown in Figure 8.

\subsection{Implications of Research}
\subsubsection{Importance of Simplified Ice Dynamics in Numerical Glacier Modeling}
\textbf{maybe include paragraph about sia model performing well, read the paper first to see if this is already done elsewhere}
These results show that complicated and computationally intensive mass balance and ice dynamics are not required to accurately model the 
runoff from small mountain glaciers. This means that we can use much simpler and less computationally intensive models such as the ones used 
in this paper to model the runoff from mountain glaciers much quicker than more complicated models. The modeling techniques used in this paper could 
easily be scaled to a much larger region if mass balance is available to tune the input parameters. Also the relative simplicity of the model used in 
this paper means that it is much easier to modify to add new features and customize to a specific region or glacier.
\paragraph{}
This point is further proved by the error of the SIA-Mass Balance model not changing significantly (less than 0.01 for the KGE and NSE, and less than 
0.1\% for the relative RMSE) when 
the ice flux is set to 0. This means that the ice dynamics of the glacier are not a significant factor contributing to the glacier runoff. One reason 
for this is the South Cascade Glacier is in an active state of retreat which can be seen in the model and the 
glacier outline in Figure 1. Since it is retreating, the model does not need the ice dynamics in order to move more glacier ice into the ablation zone 
where it can melt, much of the glacier is already in this ablation zone. 
\subsubsection{Applications}
The work of this paper shows that complex ice dynamics and precipitation models are not always required to accurately model the runoff from small mountain glaciers. This 
can have applications in everything from regional glacier modeling to water resource management as glaciers are a significant source of water 
for many communities around the world. 
\section{Future Work}
As addressed in earlier sections, this model has limited performance on shorter timescales (less than a year). A large portion of these limitations 
are probably due to the precipitation model. The easiest way to improve this would be to have more accurate temperature and precipitation data at the glacier, but 
there are some ways the model could be improved as well. For instance having a dry and wet temperature lapse rate for each month could improve the accuracy of the modeled 
temperature at the glacier. Also the missing precipitation data could be filled in using a supplementary data source or the average precipitation for that month.
Additionally increasing the resolution of the model could help improve accuracy but would also increase the runtime.
\paragraph{}
The next step for this project would be to run the model for a glacier near the South Cascade Glacier with a similar climate to see how region specific the input 
parameters are. Due to the input parameters being tuned for the mass balance of the glacier which largely depends on the local climate, it 
is plausible that they could work well for a glacier with a similar climate.
\paragraph{}
Another idea to explore is to run the model with modeled climate data in order to run the model into the future to see how this glacier 
will evolve and how the basin runoff will evolve. As shown in (Fountain and Tangborn 1985), Figure 1, the peak runoff of a glacierized basin is a function of 
how much of the basin is glacierized. It would be interesting to see how the peak runoff of this basin shifts as the glacier retreats when the model 
is run into the future.
\section{Conclusion}
The SIA-Mass Balance model is able to model the runoff from the South Cascade Glacier with a RMSE, NSE and KGE of 29.26\%, 0.81 and 0.88 respectively, 
for 16 months from 1992-2007, while OGGM errors of 45.96\%, 0.53 and 0.72 for the same time period. This show that complex models are not always 
the best way to model the runoff from small mountain glaciers. A simpler model with parameters tuned to the local climate of the glacier can 
perform just as well, if not better than a more complex model. 
\paragraph{}
From looking at the model error on various time scales, one can see that on longer time scales the SIA-Mass Balance model does quite well. More 
advanced models may be able to model the runoff on shorter timescales with more advanced methods and higher model resolution, but simple models 
like the one used in this study can work well on longer (yearly to decade) timescales.


\section*{Acknowledgements}
Thanks to the foresight of the USGS in creating the Benchmark Glacier Program in the 1950s to study and document the South Cascade glacier, 
and eventually four more glaciers, there is an abundant amount of information on these glaciers. Due to this program this study was able to 
easily access and use temperature, precipitation, mass balance and DEM data from the USGS. Also as part of this Benchmark Glacier program a 
stream gauge was installed just below the glacier to track the runoff from the basin, the data from which was essential to this project.
