test1401,test1402
Roundoff error in ComputeHessian and ComputeMetric causes different meshes
from matlab, specifically in the handling of 0/0=nan, eps/0=inf, etc.  Since
the mesh is of a different size, NR fails.  (Note Matlab test1402 currently
fails.)

test1109,test1110
Ugly crashes in solver, but same behavior as Matlab.
