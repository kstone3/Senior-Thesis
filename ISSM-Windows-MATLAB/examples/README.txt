To run the following examples, see the accompanying tutorials that can be found within the
documentation tab on the ISSM webpages: https://issm.jpl.nasa.gov/documentation/tutorials/

The tutorials were created to be parallel to lectures given,
but the tutorials are up to date on their version of ISSM. If more help is
needed see the User manual also found under the documentation tab
(https://issm.jpl.nasa.gov/documentation/).
