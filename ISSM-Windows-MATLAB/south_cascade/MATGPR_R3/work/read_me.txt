The example data provided with MATGPR


A) TESTDATA.DZT
A 400 MHz GSSI antenna was used
The time window is 100 nanoseconds
There was a 1 nanosecond offset for time zero
512 samples define each reflection trace
High Pass filter was 200 MHz
Low Pass filter was 800 MHz
There were 32 scans collected per second
Data collected as 8 bit
Data collected in equal-time spacing mode - must be transformed to equal-distant spacing.
A marker was placed in the transect every 1 meter - marker information is provided in file testdata.mrk


B) TRENCH_AND_PIPES.SU
A data set well documented by Bitri and Grandjean (Geophysical Prospecting, 46, 287-301, 1998) 
and available through Grandjean and Durand (Computers & Geosciences, 25 141-149, 1999). 
The data is provided as an SU formatted binary file and comprise a set of 12 finite sized 
diffractors buried in a trench filled with limestone sand (v = 0.165 m/ns), which was dug 
in a gneiss substratum (v = 0.125 m/ns). 
	
C) DAT_0097.RD3, DAT_0097.RAD
A 250 MHz antenna was used. The data was collected over dipping geological interfaces and there's 
ringing at times > 60 ns.
