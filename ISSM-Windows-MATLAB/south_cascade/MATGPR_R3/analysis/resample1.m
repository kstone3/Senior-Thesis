%
%RESAMPLE1 : Change the sample rate of x by a factor of p/q. Note that p
%and q do not need to be integers since this routine does not use a
%polyphase rate change algorithm, but instead uses bandlimited
%interpolation, wherein the continuous time signal is estimated by summing
%the sinc  functions of the nearest neighbouring points up to distance d.
%This is discussed in: J.O. Smith and P. Gossett (1984). A flexible
%sampling-rate conversion method. In ICASSP-84, Volume II, pp.

%   Usage : y = resample1(x,p,q,order)
%
%  Inputs :  x  is the 2-D data matrix to be resampled
%          p,q  determine the new sampling rate
%               order  is the half order of sinc summation 
%
% Outputs :  y  is the resampled data matrix

% Determine the new sampling times, and their distance to the old

% Speech example

%  sound(resample(x,16000,fs), 16000);  % resample at 16 kHz

% Example from interp1
%  xf=0:0.05:10.95; yf = sin(2*pi*xf/5);
%  xp=0:10;         yp = sin(2*pi*xp/5);
%  r = resample1(yp,xp(2),xf(2));
%  plot(xf,yf,';original;',xf,r,';resample;',xp,yp,'*;;');
% Note that resample computes all samples up to but not including time
% n+1. If you are increasing the sample rate, this means that it will
% generate samples beyond the end of the time range of the original
% signal. That is why xf must goes all the way to 10.95 in the example.
